                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p><a href="https://themercerclubnyc.com/">The Mercer Club</a> is a streetwear and luxury clothing rental company which participated in Y Combinator's Winter 2020 batch. By nature of the streetwear industry, the service is primarily intended for young men.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Understanding Phase</h3>
                <p>The product team's <b>challenge</b> is to design for an audience generally unaccustomed to the idea of clothing rental and which prides itself on ownership. Not only must the product clearly distinguish its unique service from traditional retail and resale marketplaces but also attract potential subscribers who may be apprehensive about renting luxury clothing.</p>
                <p>Given the existing beta website (built on Wordpress), our <b>approach</b> involved: </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Understand target audience through industry media analysis</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the existing product with user tests</li>
                    <li>Analyze both direct and indirect competitors - how have others solved similar problems?</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>In combination with existing research from the company, we formed a profile of a typical subscriber including information such as the types of media consumed along with expected and perceived value from The Mercer Club's services. We established our initial assumptions to prove or disprove with user testing and analytics.</p>


                <p>There is an inherent paradox which lies in providing <em>access</em> to a normally <em>exclusive</em> industry. We must design a product which provides this service while simultaneously preserving the feeling of exclusivity deeply valued by streetwear and luxury enthusiasts. We must also distinguish ourself from traditional retail and resale ecommerce platforms the industry has become so accustomed to. To guide our design, I consolidated the high-level requirements into the following <b>product wrapper model</b>:</p>
                <br>

                <div id="tmc-diagram-wrapper">
                    <img src="imgs/tmc/tmc-5.png" alt="Wrapper model diagram" class="img-1">
                </div>

                <p>From the core, we can build off of familiar patterns of an e-commerce platform (e.g. add item to shopping bag, checkout, shipping and billing information stored in account, etc.) to facilitate a seamless transition to a new type of service. Next we wrap the e-commerce platform in a layer of rental service. This added layer of complexity, however, means it is crucial to make these extra steps as easy as possible for unfamiliar users, perhaps by guiding the user through each step of the rental process using a series of modal windows. Finally, we must ensure the product resonates with its intended audience by using visuals to invoke feelings of exclusivity and authenticity.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>Ideation Phase</h3>
                <p>To transform our research into a tangible solution, I began with the landing page to form the seed for the rest of the website redesign. I created a <b>modular layout</b> starting with a blockframe (left) to outline what kind of content we would need in which general location. The modularity of this layout affords straightforward a/b testing and development to fit our stage of product development. This layout allows us to efficiently arrange, adjust, add, and remove modules. Instead of using typical lorem ipsum copy, I utilized the space to write relevant questions to guide us toward the copy we need to fill each module.</p>

                <p>Here is an example of the landing page <b>modularity</b> in action after the switch to a subscription model and other product updates:</p>
