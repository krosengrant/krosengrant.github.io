                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>I noticed a pattern. People wanted to read more but struggled to focus or find the energy to tackle traditional books after a long day at work or school. Reading for a few minutes a day, in the form of short stories, could help people get back into the habit of reading. Thus, the idea for Quick Lit was born.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Reading should be a leisure activity, so why does it feel like work? To determine what was standing between
                people and their reading goals, I pulled relevant quotes from discussions on Reddit's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books">r/books</a>. Then I tagged each of the 65 quotes with its topic ("reasons for not reading", "e-reading", etc.).
                </p>
                <p>Combining these findings with existing research on reading habits, I formed three groups of potential users:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Group A</b> &mdash; Was a "reader". Goal is to start reading again.</li>
                    <li><b>Group B</b> &mdash; Is a "reader". Goal is to discover new genres, authors, other works by favorite authors. Usually uninterested in reading short stories or on a small mobile device.</li>
                    <li><b>Group C</b> &mdash; May want to become a "reader". Goal is to try the app. (This group is largely absent from r/books, by definition).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Quick Lit is primarly intended for Group A, but must also accomodate Group B and welcome Group C members.</p>

                <p>To synthesize the research, I used the <b>"MoSCoW"</b> method to create a list of must have, should have, could have and won't have features:</p>
                <p><b>Must Have</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personalized home feed </li>
                    <li>Ability to save stories for later (or offline) reading</li>
                    <li>Stories from various sources</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Should Have</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Secure sign-in</li>
                    <li>Related stories (to encourage further reading)</li>
                    <li>Create collections of short stories</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Could Have</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Comment on stories</li>
                    <li>Upload own short stories from sources</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Won't Have</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ability to write and post own stories</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                <p>Created wireframes with Adobe Xd for testing prior to creating a high-fidelity prototype</p>

                <h3>User Testing</h3>
                <p>Without a budget or panel to turn to for my side project, I recruited a friend to test the prototype by completing the following tasks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Onboarding</li>
                    <li>Find a story to read</li>
                    <li>Go back to home feed</li>
                    <li>Continue reading story</li>
                    <li>Add a story to "Read Later" collection</li>
                    <li>Change color of page in the settings menu</li>
                    <li>Find stories from the category, "Contemporary"</li>
                    <li>Sign out of account</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I also took note of key observations during the test:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>User tried to turn on automatic night mode to change the page color to black (instead of looking under the "color" setting)</li>
                    <li>User did not notice the menu bar until scrolling to the bottom of the home feed</li>
                    <li>User scrolled up and down looking for the "Collections" tab in the menu bar</li>
                    <li>User was not sure if the settings were saved automatically or not</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some areas of weakness and future improvements include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty locating settings icon &#8594; Replace adjustment slider icon with gear icon</li>
                    <li>Difficulty noticing tab bar initially &#8594; Page cover preview may make tab bar blend in with rest of feed. Try
                        adding color to tab bar. </li>
                    <li>Confusion regarding turning on "night mode" (black background with white text) &#8594; Consolidate "color" and "automatic nightmode" options into one category</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Areas the user enjoyed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time-to-read estimate</li>
                    <li>"Welcome back" banner at the top of the home feed</li>
                    <li>Easy to resume story from bottom menu</li>
                    <li>"Everything is in reach [of my thumb]." </li>
                </ul>
                <p>At the end of the test, I asked the user to discuss their overall experience, what they enjoyed the most/least, who they think the app is designed for, and what other apps they use on a daily basis.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Project Retrospective</h3>
                <p>In an ideal world, I would be able to test the app with multiple users with actual content and personalized feeds.</p>
                <p>I would like to perform unmoderated user tests with <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">User Testing</a> or a similar service to uncover other potential pain points in the design. Also, I would like to determine what other features users expect beyond the baseline features included in this iteration.</p>
