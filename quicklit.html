                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>I noticed a pattern. People wanted to read more but were having trouble focusing or finding the energy to tackle traditional books after a long day. Reading for a few minutes a day, in the form of short stories, could help people get back into the habit of reading.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Reading should be a leisure activity, so why does it feel like work? I wanted to determine what was standing between
                people and their reading goals. To do this, I pulled relevant quotes from discussions on Reddit's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books">r/books</a>. 
                </p>

                <p>These relevant discussions revolved around short stories, different mediums (electronic vs. paper), audiobooks and reasons for
                reading or not reading. I then added tags for "reasons for reading" and "reasons for not reading". Combined with
                existing research on reading habits, I created a persona to describe the  anticipated typical user.</p>

                <p>I tagged each quote to determine why people were not reading even though they wanted to. I consolidated these reasons
                into a list of user needs to determine what features should be included.</p>
                <p>I also researched competing mobile apps to determine which features would distinguish Quick Lit. To synthesize this research, I created a list of features using the "MoSCoW" method to list the must have, should have, could have and won't have features.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>User Testing</h3>
                <p>Based on low and high fidelity prototype testing, the user enjoyed the "[X] minute read" estimate feature, the "Welcome back, [name]" next to the resume story button at the top of the app's home page, and the ability to resume reading from the tab bar menu.</p>
                <p>Some areas of weakness and future improvements include</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty locating settings icon &#8594; Replace adjustment slider icon with gear icon</li>
                    <li>Difficulty noticing tab bar initially &#8594; Page cover preview may make tab bar blend in with rest of feed. Try
                        adding color to tab bar. </li>
                    <li>Confusion regarding turning on "night mode" (black background with white text) &#8594; Consolidate "color" and "automatic nightmode" options into one category</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Project Retrospective</h3>
                <p>I would like to perform more user testing to determine which other features users expect in the app beyond the baseline features I included.</p>
