                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>I noticed a pattern. People wanted to read more but struggled to focus or find the energy to tackle traditional books after a long day of work or school. Reading for a few minutes a day, in the form of short stories, could help people get back into the habit of reading.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Reading should be a leisure activity, so why does it feel like work? To determine what was standing between
                people and their reading goals, I pulled relevant quotes from discussions on Reddit's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books">r/books</a>. Then I tagged each of the 65 quotes with its topic ("reasons for not reading", "e-reading", etc.).
                </p>
                <p>Combining these findings with existing research on reading habits, I formed three groups of potential users:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Group A</b> &mdash; Was a "reader". Goal is to start reading again.</li>
                    <li><b>Group B</b> &mdash; Is a "reader". Goal is to discover new genres, authors, other works by favorite authors. Usually uninterested in reading short stories or on a small mobile device.</li>
                    <li><b>Group C</b> &mdash; May want to become a "reader". Goal is to try the app. (This group is largely absent from r/books, by definition).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Quick Lit is primarly intended for Group A, but must also accomodate Group B and welcome Group C members.</p>

                <p>To synthesize the research, I used the "MoSCoW" method to create a list of must have, should have, could have and won't have features.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>User Testing</h3>
                <p>Based on low and high fidelity prototype testing, the user enjoyed the time-to-read estimate on the story page, the "Welcome back, [name]" banner on the home feed, and the ability to quickly resume a story from the bottom menu.</p>
                <p>Some areas of weakness and future improvements include</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty locating settings icon &#8594; Replace adjustment slider icon with gear icon</li>
                    <li>Difficulty noticing tab bar initially &#8594; Page cover preview may make tab bar blend in with rest of feed. Try
                        adding color to tab bar. </li>
                    <li>Confusion regarding turning on "night mode" (black background with white text) &#8594; Consolidate "color" and "automatic nightmode" options into one category</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Project Retrospective</h3>
                <p>I would like to perform more user testing to determine which other features users expect in the app beyond the baseline features I included.</p>
