                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>During my senior year at UC Santa Cruz, I began to discover the world of design. Around the same time my capstone course, Web Applications, announced we should begin forming teams for the capstone project. I knew I wanted to create something new that would help other people so I began looking at other areas of my life for inspiration. I recalled the times my parents asked me tech-support questions during winter break and realized that knowledge of user interface conventions would have solved their problems. Thus, the idea for Nimble was born. A web application seniors could use to learn how to navigate their devices quickly and easily.</p>
                <p>I presented my idea to the class and recruited five other students who were also interested in helping their parents and grandparents feel confident using technology.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>This was my first ever design project and I had only a few days to learn about the UX design process and come up with a plan so we could begin development.</p>
                <p>First, I looked into existing research on the topic including other ways people have tried to solve this issue. There were several websites and mobile applications designed to teach seniors how to perform specific tasks online, but nothing which taught general user interface design conventions.</p>
                <p>Based on questions I've answered for my parents, I came up with a curriculum of common icons, terminology and tasks.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>For simplicity, I chose to use a flashcard-style mental model which users can navigate between using next or previous buttons, or the navigation bar on the side. The side navigation bar is numbered as the course is intended to be used sequentially with the option to skip sections. </p>

                <br>
                <h3>Project Retrospective</h3>
                <p>This project was certainly a learning experience, I would love to overhaul the visual design and perform more user tests. I learned how to work well with a team in a time-constricted environment.</p>
